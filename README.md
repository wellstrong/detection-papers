# detection-papers
Notes on a variety of published papers on different techniques to detect anomalous, suspicious, and/or malicious behavior in a network. 

The PDFs of the papers won't be uploaded to this repository to avoid any legal issues, but I'll make sure to include proper citations if you want to access the papers yourself.

Hoping to go through an average rate of a paper per week in 2024!
